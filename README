DESCRIPTION

      This project is a C++ implementation of a spell checker using CMake as build system.
      In the first step, the program builds a compiled dictionnary using a text file provided
      by the user. Then, the program is able to output a list of words that is at a defined
      distance of a word both given in input by the user.
